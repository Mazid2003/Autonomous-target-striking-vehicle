2️⃣ Ultrasonic Sensors (HC-SR04) – For obstacle detection and navigation.
3️⃣ Camera Module (e.g., Raspberry Pi Camera or USB Webcam) – For real-time target detection.
4️⃣ DC Motors & Motor Driver (L298N or similar) – For vehicle movement and control.
5️⃣ Servo Motor (SG90 or MG995) – For aiming the target engagement mechanism.
6️⃣ Power Supply (Li-Po Battery or 18650 Battery Pack) – To power the system.
7️⃣ Buzzer & LEDs – For status indication and alerts.
8️⃣ WiFi / RF Module – For remote control and data transmission (if needed).

💻 Software Requirements
1️⃣ Python (for real-time object detection)
2️⃣ OpenCV – For image processing and target recognition.
3️⃣ TensorFlow / YOLOv8 – For real-time object detection and classification.
4️⃣ PySerial – For communication between Python and Arduino.
5️⃣ Arduino IDE – For programming the microcontroller.
6️⃣ Flask / MQTT (optional) – If integrating a remote monitoring system.
