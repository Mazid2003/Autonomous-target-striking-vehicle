Autonomous Target Striking Vehicle Project Overview The Autonomous Target Striking Vehicle is an unmanned vehicle prototype developed for defense applications, designed to
autonomously identify, track, and engage specified targets. Using advanced sensors, computer vision, and real-time data processing, the vehicle operates with high precision, 
making it suitable for deployment in high-risk or remote environments. This project demonstrates the potential of autonomous systems to support military operations by minimizing
human involvement in dangerous missions.
Technologies Used Computer Vision for target recognition and tracking Sensor Integration for obstacle detection and navigation Autonomous Control Algorithms to 
manage navigation and target engagement Future Improvements Potential future developments include improved obstacle avoidance, enhanced accuracy, and integration of 
machine learning models for adaptive target recognition in complex environments.
In this repository, Arduino.ion is a file which consists of Wifi module code (ESP8266) where you have to dump your code in the ESP8266 module.

Object detection.py is a file, where it consists of real time object detection code.
